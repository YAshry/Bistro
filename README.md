Hey Developer!

You just need to make sure of these before getting started:
1) Install node modules
2) Make sure you have your data base in mongodb ready and make sure "config" file in ExpressFiles folder contains your credentials
3) To start the project just run the mongodb database first then ExpressFiles and then run the ReactFiles

Good Luck!
